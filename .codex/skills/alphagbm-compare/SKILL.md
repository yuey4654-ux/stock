# AlphaGBM Compare

Side-by-side comparison of 2-5 stocks or options across every AlphaGBM dimension, so you can pick the best opportunity.

## What This Skill Does

|-----------|--------------------|
| GBM Five Pillars | Momentum, Value, Quality, Volatility, Sentiment scores for each ticker |
| Options Metrics | IV rank, IV percentile, VRP, skew, term structure for each ticker |
| Technicals | RSI, MACD, moving averages, support/resistance levels |
| Valuations | P/E, P/S, EV/EBITDA, PEG ratio — who is cheaper? |
| Category Winner | Best ticker in each dimension highlighted |
| Overall Recommendation | Weighted composite ranking across all dimensions |
