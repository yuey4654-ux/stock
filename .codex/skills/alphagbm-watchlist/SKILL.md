# AlphaGBM Watchlist

Monitor your favorite tickers for meaningful changes -- price moves, IV shifts, unusual activity, upcoming earnings, and score changes -- all in one dashboard.

## What This Skill Does

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Custom Watchlists | Create and manage personal lists of tickers to track |
| Hot Options List | Default curated list of tickers with the most interesting options activity |
| Price Alerts | Flags significant price moves (gap up/down, breakout, breakdown) |
| IV Rank Changes | Highlights tickers where IV rank crossed key thresholds (e.g., above 80 or below 20) |
| Unusual Activity | Surfaces any unusual options flow on watchlist tickers |
| Earnings Approaching | Warns when a watchlist ticker has earnings within the next 7 days |
| Priority Ranking | Notifications ranked by importance so you see what matters first |

## How to Use

**Input:** Watchlist management command or query.

**Output:**
- Watchlist dashboard: each ticker with current price, daily change, IV rank, next earnings date
