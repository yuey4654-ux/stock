  Score and rank options contracts for any ticker using AlphaGBM's multi-factor
  scoring model (liquidity, IV attractiveness, Greeks balance, risk/reward). Returns
  scored option chains with the best contracts highlighted. Use when: evaluating
  which option to trade, finding the best strike/expiry, ranking options by quality.
  Triggers on: "score AAPL options", "best options for NVDA", "which TSLA call
  should I buy", "option chain for SPY", "rank META puts".

# AlphaGBM Options Score

## Prerequisites

- **API Key**: Set env `ALPHAGBM_API_KEY` (format `agbm_xxxx...`).
- **Base URL**: Default `https://alphagbm.zeabur.app`. Override with env `ALPHAGBM_BASE_URL`.

## What This Skill Does

Scores every option contract in a chain using a **multi-factor model** across 4 strategy types, so you instantly know which contracts have the best risk/reward profile.

### Strategy Scoring Models

#### Sell Put Weights

| Factor | Weight | Description |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| premium_yield | 20% | Annualized return from premium |
| support_strength | 20% | Proximity to key support levels |
| safety_margin | 15% | ATR-adjusted OTM buffer |
| trend_alignment | 15% | Downtrend = 100, Uptrend = 30 |
| probability_profit | 15% | Black-Scholes prob of expiring OTM |
| liquidity | 10% | Volume + OI + spread |
| time_decay | 5% | 20-45 DTE optimal |

#### Sell Call Weights

| Factor | Weight |
|--------|--------|
| premium_yield | 20% |
| resistance_strength | 20% |
| trend_alignment | 15% |
| upside_buffer | 15% |
| liquidity | 10% |
| is_covered | 10% |
| time_decay | 5% |
| overvaluation | 5% |

#### Buy Call Weights

| Factor | Weight |
|--------|--------|
| bullish_momentum | 25% |
| breakout_potential | 20% |
| value_efficiency | 20% |
| volatility_timing | 15% |
| liquidity | 10% |
| time_optimization | 10% |

#### Buy Put Weights

| Factor | Weight |
|--------|--------|
| bearish_momentum | 25% |
| support_break | 20% |
| value_efficiency | 20% |
| volatility_expansion | 15% |
| liquidity | 10% |
| time_value | 10% |

### Score Scale
- **80-100**: Exceptional — top-tier opportunity
- **60-79**: Strong — good trade candidate
- **40-59**: Average — proceed with caution
- **0-39**: Poor — avoid unless hedging

### Risk-Return Profiles

| Style | Typical Win Rate | Typical Return |
|-------|-----------------|----------------|
| steady_income | 65-80% | 1-5%/month |
| balanced | 40-55% | 50-200% |
| high_risk_high_reward | 20-40% | 2-10x |
| hedge | 30-50% | 0-1x |

## API Endpoints

### Get Option Expirations

```
GET /api/options/expirations/<SYMBOL>
```

### Option Chain Analysis -- Synchronous

```
POST /api/options/chain-sync
Content-Type: application/json

{"symbol": "AAPL", "expiry_date": "2026-04-17"}
```

Add `?compact=true` for condensed response.

Response includes for each of 4 strategies (Sell Put, Sell Call, Buy Call, Buy Put):
- Top 10 recommendations sorted by score (0-100)
- Score breakdown: premium_yield, support/resistance_strength, safety_margin, trend_alignment, probability_profit, liquidity, time_decay
- ATR safety info (safety_ratio, atr_multiples, is_safe)
- Risk-return profile: style, risk_level, win_probability
- Trend analysis: direction, strength, alignment score

### Option Chain Analysis -- Async

```
POST /api/options/chain-async
Content-Type: application/json

{"symbol": "TSLA", "expiry_date": "2026-04-17"}
```

Returns `{"task_id": "uuid"}`. Poll with: `GET /api/tasks/<task_id>`.

### Enhanced Single-Option Analysis -- Sync

```
POST /api/options/enhanced-sync
Content-Type: application/json

{"symbol": "AAPL", "option_identifier": "AAPL260417C00190000"}
```

### Enhanced Single-Option Analysis -- Async

```
POST /api/options/enhanced-async
Content-Type: application/json

{"symbol": "AAPL", "option_identifier": "AAPL260417C00190000"}
```

### Reverse Score

Score a specific contract from known parameters:

```
POST /api/options/reverse-score
Content-Type: application/json

{"symbol": "AAPL", "option_type": "CALL", "strike": 190, "expiry_date": "2026-02-16", "option_price": 2.50, "implied_volatility": 28}
```

### Batch Chain Analysis

```
POST /api/options/chain/batch
Content-Type: application/json

{"symbols": ["AAPL", "NVDA"], "expiries": ["2026-04-17", "2026-05-15"]}
```

Max 3 symbols x 2 expiries per request.

### IV Snapshot (instant, no quota cost)

```
GET /api/options/snapshot/<SYMBOL>
```

Returns: ATM IV, IV Rank, HV 30d, VRP, VRP level.

### Daily Recommendations (no auth required)

```
GET /api/options/recommendations?count=5
```

## Typical Workflow

1. **Get expirations**: `GET /api/options/expirations/AAPL`
2. **Quick IV check**: `GET /api/options/snapshot/AAPL` (free, no quota)
3. **Run chain analysis**: `POST /api/options/chain-sync` with symbol + expiry
4. **Drill into a specific contract**: `POST /api/options/enhanced-sync` with option_identifier
5. **Compare across tickers**: `POST /api/options/chain/batch` for multi-symbol analysis

## Quota

- **Free**: 1 options analysis/day
- **Plus**: 1,000/month
- **Pro**: 5,000/month
- Snapshot and recommendations endpoints cost nothing.

## Output Formatting Tips

- Scores are 0-100; present top picks in a table sorted by score descending.
- Always show the score breakdown factors so users understand *why* a contract scored well.
- Highlight ATR safety info (is_safe flag) prominently for sell strategies.
- Include the risk-return style label (steady_income, balanced, etc.) for quick context.

### Example Queries

| User Says | What Happens |
|-----------|-------------|
| "Score AAPL options" | Full chain with scores, top picks highlighted |
| "Best NVDA call to buy" | Filtered to calls, sorted by score descending |
| "TSLA puts for next Friday" | Filtered by expiry + type |
| "Which SPY option has the best risk/reward?" | Sorted by risk_reward factor |

### Mock Data

Demo tickers available without API key: AAPL, NVDA, SPY, TSLA, META. Uses realistic option chain snapshots from `mock-data/`.
