description: >
  3D volatility surface analysis mapping implied volatility across strikes (moneyness)
  and expirations. Shows whether options are cheap or expensive at every point on
  the surface. Returns surface grid data, ATM term structure, skew by expiry, and
  surface anomalies. Use when: checking if IV is expensive, analyzing term structure,
  finding mispriced options, understanding volatility dynamics.

# AlphaGBM Volatility Surface

## Prerequisites

- **API Key**: Set env `ALPHAGBM_API_KEY` (format `agbm_xxxx...`).
- **Base URL**: Default `https://alphagbm.zeabur.app`. Override with env `ALPHAGBM_BASE_URL`.

## What This Skill Does

Builds a **3D volatility surface** for any optionable ticker, mapping implied volatility across two dimensions -- strike price (moneyness) and time to expiration. Identifies where options are cheap, expensive, or anomalous relative to the surface.

### Key Outputs

| Output | What It Shows |
|--------|--------------|
| **Surface Grid** | IV at each (strike, expiry) coordinate -- the full 3D map |
| **ATM Term Structure** | How at-the-money IV changes across expirations (front-month vs. back-month) |
| **Skew by Expiry** | Put-call IV differential at each expiration -- measures fear/complacency |
| **Surface Anomalies** | Points where IV deviates significantly from the fitted surface -- potential mispricings |
| **Surface Shape** | Classification: contango, backwardation, flat, inverted, event-driven |

### What the Surface Tells You

- **Contango** (front IV < back IV): Normal market, no near-term fear
- **Backwardation** (front IV > back IV): Near-term event expected (earnings, FDA, etc.)
- **Steep skew**: Market pricing tail risk in puts -- hedging demand is high
- **Flat skew**: Balanced sentiment -- no strong directional fear
- **Anomaly detected**: A specific contract is mispriced vs. neighbors -- potential opportunity

### Volatility Risk Premium (VRP)

```
VRP = Implied Vol - Historical Vol
```

| VRP Level | Seller | Buyer |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| very_high (>=15%) | Very favorable | Unfavorable |
| high (5-15%) | Favorable | Slightly unfavorable |
| normal (+/-5%) | Neutral | Neutral |
| low (-15% to -5%) | Unfavorable | Favorable |
| very_low (<-15%) | Very unfavorable | Very favorable |

## API Endpoints

### Volatility Surface (3D)

```
GET /api/options/tools/vol-surface/<SYMBOL>
```

Returns the full 3D volatility surface with moneyness axis, expiry axis, and IV grid.

### IV Snapshot (quick check, no quota cost)

For a fast ATM IV / IV Rank / HV / VRP check without pulling the full surface:

```
GET /api/options/snapshot/<SYMBOL>
```

Returns: ATM IV, IV Rank, HV 30d, VRP, VRP level.

## How to Use

### Input
- **Required**: Ticker symbol
- **Optional**: Moneyness range (e.g., 0.8-1.2), expiration range (e.g., 7-90 days)
