# AlphaGBM Unusual Options Activity

Detects unusual options activity and classifies smart money signals to help you follow institutional positioning.

## What This Skill Does

| Concept | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Volume/OI Ratio | When today's volume far exceeds open interest, it signals new positioning |
| Block Trade | A single large transaction (typically 100+ contracts) executed at one price |
| Sweep Order | Aggressive order that sweeps across multiple exchanges to get filled fast — indicates urgency |
| Premium Flow | Net dollar amount of call vs put premium — shows directional conviction |
| Sentiment Classification | Categorizes activity as bullish sweep, bearish block, hedging, or earnings positioning |
| Historical Accuracy | How often past unusual activity correctly predicted direction |

## How to Use

**Input:** A ticker symbol or market-wide scan request.

**Output:**
- Unusual activity list: timestamp, strike, expiry, type (call/put), volume, OI, premium, trade classification
- Sentiment classification per trade (bullish sweep, bearish block, hedging, earnings positioning)
- Net premium flow (calls vs puts in dollar terms)
- Historical accuracy: how often similar signals preceded the expected move
- Aggregated smart money score
